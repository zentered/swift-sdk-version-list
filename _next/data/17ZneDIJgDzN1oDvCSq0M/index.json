While existentials are best avoided when possible, in this case, the relaxed definition allows usefully operating on the resolved database field names of an arbitrary set of key paths without the use of variadic generics.\r\n\r\nAs this is a very confusing and opaque description of the behavior, here is an example of a helper method which was impossible to write before:\r\n\r\n```swift\r\nextension SchemaBuilder {\r\n    func fields<M: FluentKit.Model>(from _: M.Type = M.self, _ keypaths: KeyPath<M, AnyQueryableProperty>...) -> Self {\r\n        return keypaths.reduce(self) { builder, keypath in\r\n            // N.B.: Despite the name and array type, `Fields.path(for:)` never returns more than one `FieldKey` in practice.\r\n            // Implementing `figureOutDataType(for:)` is left as an exercise for the reader.\r\n            return builder.field(M.path(for: keypath).first!, figureOutDataType(for: keypath))\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n\r\n// Usage would be something like:\r\ndatabase.schema(M.schema)\r\n    .fields(\\.$id, \\.$foo, \\.$bar, \\$.baz)\r\n    .create()\r\n```\r\n\r\nPreviously, such a helper could only have taken a single `KeyPath` parameter. This is admittedly a contrived example (and by design very far from a complete \"automatic migration\" implementation), and it's a fairly small convenience to call `.fields(a,b,c,d)` versus `.field(a).field(b).field(c).field(d)`, but it's nonetheless useful. The generic constraint should never have been so strict in any event. (And field keys should not be wrapped in arrays all the time, but that's a PR for another day.)\r\n\r\n_Note: While technically the relaxed constraint is a \"new\" public API, the change is small enough and the difference invisible enough that I've marked this semver-patch; even for me, there's such a thing as being too pedantic about the rules üôÇ._","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vapor/fluent-kit/releases/62234318","authors":[{"id":73653552,"avatarUrl":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/73653552?v=4","login":"VaporBot","url":"https://api.github.com/users/VaporBot"}]}},{"id":171034222,"name":"mysql-nio","fullName":"vapor/mysql-nio","description":"üê¨ Non-blocking, event-driven Swift client for MySQL.","watchers":42,"forks":17,"stargazers":42,"url":"https://github.com/vapor/mysql-nio.git","htmlUrl":"https://github.com/vapor/mysql-nio","owner":{"login":"vapor"},"isCopied":false,"latestRelease":{"tag":"1.4.0","name":"Improve error handling","notes":"###### _This patch was authored and released by @gwynne._\n\n- \"Connection closed\" errors are now correctly reported when trying to issue queries on closed connections, instead of throwing various NIO errors.\r\n- Query syntax errors are now explicitly reported.\r\n- Unique constraint violation errors are now more consistently reported.\r\n\r\n`semver-minor` due to adding a new case on `MySQLError`.","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vapor/mysql-nio/releases/54737433","authors":[{"id":73653552,"avatarUrl":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/73653552?v=4","login":"VaporBot","url":"https://api.github.com/users/VaporBot"}]}},{"id":180674964,"name":"sqlite-nio","fullName":"vapor/sqlite-nio","description":"Non-blocking wrapper for libsqlite3-dev using SwiftNIO","watchers":30,"forks":10,"stargazers":30,"url":"https://github.com/vapor/sqlite-nio.git","htmlUrl":"https://github.com/vapor/sqlite-nio","owner":{"login":"vapor"},"isCopied":false,"latestRelease":{"tag":"1.1.0","name":"Improve SQLite Boolean decoding","notes":"###### _This patch was authored by @wibed and released by @tanner0101._\n\nAllows for a boolean field to be stored as string.\r\n\r\n```swift\r\n.field(\"is_true\", .string, .required)\r\n```\r\nAdditionally it is now its separate type, together with the other types, instead of referring to an anonymous int \r\nfor a return, which makes It cleaner.\r\n\r\nBefore:\r\nIf the field type of a presumed boolean is set to string. it results in below error msg\r\n\r\n```\r\ntypeMismatch(Swift.Bool, Swift.DecodingError.Context(codingPath: [], debugDescription: \"Could not initialize Bool from \\\"0\\\".\", underlyingError: nil))\r\n```","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vapor/sqlite-nio/releases/31781575","authors":[{"id":1342803,"avatarUrl":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1342803?v=4","login":"tanner0101","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tanner0101"}]}},{"id":226194576,"name":"jwt-kit","fullName":"vapor/jwt-kit","description":"üîë JSON Web Token signing and verification (HMAC, RSA, ECDSA) using BoringSSL.","watchers":62,"forks":21,"stargazers":62,"url":"https://github.com/vapor/jwt-kit.git","htmlUrl":"https://github.com/vapor/jwt-kit","owner":{"login":"vapor"},"isCopied":false,"latestRelease":{"tag":"4.4.0","name":"Expose the curve on ECDSA Keys","notes":"###### _This patch was authored by @danramteke and released by @0xTim._\n\nExposes the `Curve` on `ECDSAKey`s","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vapor/jwt-kit/releases/61686949","authors":[{"id":73653552,"avatarUrl":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/73653552?v=4","login":"VaporBot","url":"https://api.github.com/users/VaporBot"}]}},{"id":241157104,"name":"fluent-mongo-driver","fullName":"vapor/fluent-mongo-driver","description":"MongoDB support for Fluent built on MongoKittten.","watchers":13,"forks":7,"stargazers":13,"url":"https://github.com/vapor/fluent-mongo-driver.git","htmlUrl":"https://github.com/vapor/fluent-mongo-driver","owner":{"login":"vapor"},"isCopied":false,"latestRelease":{"tag":"1.1.0","name":"Make `FluentMongoError` public","notes":"###### _This patch was authored by @MFranceschi6 and released by @0xTim._\n\nMake `FluentMongoError` public so it can be examined by end-users.\r\n\r\nFixes #45 \r\n","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vapor/fluent-mongo-driver/releases/61489167","authors":[{"id":73653552,"avatarUrl":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/73653552?v=4","login":"VaporBot","url":"https://api.github.com/users/VaporBot"}]}}]},"__N_SSG":true}
