For example, a request to `http://server.com/path/` may automatically serve the file at `path/index.html`.\r\n\r\nThis PR adds this functionality to the FileMiddleware via an initialization parameter. It defaults to disabled but can be customized to whatever default file name is desired. This default file name is also served automatically for all subdirectory queries. If the default file does not exist, the request is passed on to the next Responder.\r\n\r\nA usage example:\r\n\r\n```swift\r\n// Default file serving is disabled\r\napp.middleware.use(FileMiddleware(publicDirectory: \"public/\"))\r\n\r\n// Serves `index.html` (if it exists) to a request to `http://server.com/`, as well as any subdirectories\r\napp.middleware.use(FileMiddleware(publicDirectory: \"public/\", defaultFile: \"index.html\"))\r\n```\r\n\r\nResolves: https://github.com/vapor/vapor/issues/2455\r\n\r\n<!-- When this PR is merged, the title and body will be -->\r\n<!-- used to generate a release automatically. -->\r\n","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vapor/vapor/releases/54727273","authors":[{"id":73653552,"avatarUrl":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/73653552?v=4","login":"VaporBot","url":"https://api.github.com/users/VaporBot"}]}},{"id":50543206,"name":"fluent","fullName":"vapor/fluent","description":"Vapor ORM (queries, models, and relations) for NoSQL and SQL databases","watchers":1112,"forks":158,"stargazers":1112,"url":"https://github.com/vapor/fluent.git","htmlUrl":"https://github.com/vapor/fluent","owner":{"login":"vapor"},"isCopied":false,"latestRelease":{"tag":"4.4.0","name":"Add support for async/await","notes":"###### _This patch was authored and released by @0xTim._\n\nAdds initial support for async/await\r\n","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vapor/fluent/releases/52072979","authors":[{"id":73653552,"avatarUrl":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/73653552?v=4","login":"VaporBot","url":"https://api.github.com/users/VaporBot"}]}},{"id":51437063,"name":"redis","fullName":"vapor/redis","description":"Vapor provider for RediStack","watchers":444,"forks":52,"stargazers":444,"url":"https://github.com/vapor/redis.git","htmlUrl":"https://github.com/vapor/redis","owner":{"login":"vapor"},"isCopied":false,"latestRelease":{"tag":"4.5.0","name":"Add support for `async`/`await`","notes":"###### _This patch was authored and released by @0xTim._\n\nAdd `async` APIs for Redis\r\n","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vapor/redis/releases/52074725","authors":[{"id":73653552,"avatarUrl":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/73653552?v=4","login":"VaporBot","url":"https://api.github.com/users/VaporBot"}]}},{"id":52336200,"name":"fluent-mysql-driver","fullName":"vapor/fluent-mysql-driver","description":"üñãüê¨ Swift ORM (queries, models, relations, etc) built on MySQL.","watchers":64,"forks":48,"stargazers":64,"url":"https://github.com/vapor/fluent-mysql-driver.git","htmlUrl":"https://github.com/vapor/fluent-mysql-driver","owner":{"login":"vapor"},"isCopied":false,"latestRelease":{"tag":"4.0.2","name":"Improved error reporting via `DatabaseError`","notes":"###### _This patch was authored and released by @gwynne._\n\n`DatabaseError`'s `isSyntaxError` and `isConnectionClosed` properties now correctly respect `MySQLError.invalidSyntax` and `MySQLError.closed` errors.
